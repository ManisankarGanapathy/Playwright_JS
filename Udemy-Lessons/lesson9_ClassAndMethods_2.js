
import { custDetailsObjects } from "./Helper/printHelper_2.js"; // Importing the instance of CustomerDetails

// Using the imported instance to call the method
custDetailsObjects.printFN("Alice"); // Calling the method to print the first name


// Instance is create in the imported file and method is called here - 2nd type of import
// This demonstrates another way to use the class without creating a new instance in this file.
